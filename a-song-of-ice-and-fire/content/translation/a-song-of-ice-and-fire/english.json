	"map.hota_ashai.event.0.description" : "Darissey rarely left the walls of Ashai, and therefore could not imagine how dangerous the edge of the shadows was. The further it moved into the depths of the mainland, the heavier the air was, and the more terrible creatures I wanted to enjoy the priestess and its army. \n\nTen days later, she realized that the path to Lord Dassar could drag on for months, and she could not afford that.\n\nDistributing money and paying the mercenaries tens of times more, Darisseya tried to take out her enemies in numbers, but the more she resisted, the stronger her opponents became, and the faster her wallets became thinner. \n",
	"map.hota_ashai.event.1.description" : "Darisseya woke up in a cold sweat. For the first time, her spacious room seemed smaller than a prison cell. To dispel the darkness and horror, she ran to the fireplace and began to light a fire without waiting for the servants to do it. The Lord of Light should have given advice, dispelled her fears, told her that the night vision was just a nightmare, not a prophecy.\n\nIn the moisture of the coastal stone house, the flame flared up the flame, but the faith of Darissai was able to carve the calf flame even at the bottom of the ocean. The fire lit a room, gave warmth and hope.\n\nHowever, what Darissey saw inside the fire frightened her even more evil dreams. Millions of the revived dead walked around the lands of people, and at the head of the army stood white -skinned creatures. Ice sapphires burned in their eyes, their swords were made of ice. There was human fear in front of them, and behind only cold and darkness.\n\nDarisseya closed her eyes in horror; she did not want to see what the Lord of Light wanted to show next. All she could do was whisper the question: \"What can I..?\"\n\nThe flame flared brighter, forcing the priestess to open her eyes again. The vision changed, and now a child was looking at Darisseya from the fire. In his cradle he tossed and turned to keep warm, but did not cry. He was preparing to withstand the frost with all his strength, even if he himself did not yet realize it. \n\n\"Winter child is an answer to everything,\" the priestess whispered, and only a minute later realized that it was not her word. \n\nThe lord of Sveta frightened her, but gave hope, gave a weapon and again fenced her faith in the future. Darissey knew where one should sail - to the edge of the frost, where the great other, the lord of the darkness, was preparing to send his innumerable army.\n\nImmediately dressed in her luxurious scarlet robes, Darissea suddenly stopped at the door. She couldn\"t leave, couldn\"t give up everything, even if the fate of the human world now depended on her. Vows, vows, she made so many of them. So many people needed her, so many promises and vows that she could not break.\n\nDassar, the ruler of the region, three decades ago gave her shelter, food, and did everything so that the priestess would not need anything, and in return asked only for the grace of the Lord of Light, and the presence of Darissea in Asshai, so that this light would never fade away. At least as long as Dassar\"s own heart beats.\n\nThe oath was accepted and for thirty years the priestess did not leave the edge of the shadows, as the master ordered.\n\nThe decision came to her immediately. Before leaving for Westeros, Darissea must travel north to the city of Carcosa, where Dassar\"s residence was now located. She had to hurry. Through the mountains of the Land of Shadows, through the Hidden Sea, through the city of the Winged Men...\n\n\"What if he refuses me?\" - black thought crept into the head.\n\n\"Then I will do everything that owes the oath to be performed,\" she answered herself, a sad horse.",

Ashai\"s surroundings became much calmer, but the path to the city of winged people, the only peaceful place outside the edge of the shadows, was still dangerous. Darissey clenched her fists, angry, screamed at the soldier, but was getting closer to the idea that the straight road was not always the shortest.\n\nHaving spent another sleepless night by the fire, she began to reflect on the new tactics. Perhaps she really should go around all the surroundings, to enlist the help of supporters from other cities of the region, and only then move to Dassar.

Accelerate your army, return to Ashai and maybe over time I can forgive you \"\n\n\"I... I can\"t\"\n\n\"So this is your choice\"\n\nDassar and his retinue galloped away.

Refugees flocked here from all the outskirts, and from their appearance it immediately became clear that they were saved from the fire only by a miracle. \n\nThe distribution of refugees was engaged in a tall man with a magnificent snow -white mustache and in full combat vestments. Leaving the army, Darissey drove up to him to find out about the causes of the disaster.\n\n\"What do you think, Madam Priestess?\" said the man and chuckled into his mustache. \"Of course it's a dragon!\"\n\nDragons... Darisseya also saw them in a vision, but considered it a metaphor. In the vision there were three of them - black, yellow and green, and the three of them were circling around a naked girl with silver hair.\n\n\"Huge that this is a mountain,\" the man continued and looked cautiously into the sky. \"He will ever get here when he is hungry again.

If there are hundreds of them, then there are thousands behind the mountain, and any collapse will turn their shelter into the grave.\n\n\"This is not a place for people,\" said Darissey to the guard.\n\n\"This Vladyka said so? Well, tell him that we do not have another, and until the dragon will be forgotten to breathe with fire or does not switch from meat to vegetables. I heard that those who refuse meat feel stopped ... \"\n\nDarisseya did not listen to the man. She turned her horse around and headed back to her army.

Did you think they robbed me? I was expelled from Ashay because I loved to peep at the noble sluts. My favorite telescope then took the guard.

It didn't take long to find volunteers, and one by one the archers began shooting at the poor guard. He has nowhere to hide, so shouting and waving his arms, he quickly runs down the inner steps of the tower. \n\nHaving caught his breath, he appears before Lianna and falls to his knees, finally recognizing her as his mistress. Stuttering and shaking, the guard nevertheless explains that he was born and raised on this tower, just like his father before him, and since the watchtower is located in the wilderness, he has never seen Mormonts or any other lords. But for some time now, life became unbearable - because of the war, food supplies were interrupted, and he was forced to hunt himself. And his house, this very tower, is no longer repairable and is about to collapse.  \n\nLianna examines the tower and understands that the guard is right. There is more harm from the tower than good. Perhaps it should really be demolished, since it is a pointless occupation to watch these forests and the guards\" hands will come in handy in the war. \n\nBut when asked to help with the demolition, the guard shakes his head. \"It cannot be demolished,\" he explained, because it is forbidden by the servants of the Seven who live southwest of here. If Lianna had persuaded them to take such a step, the guard would have happily demolished this tower and joined her.\n\nLianna agrees to help.\n",

The scouts reported on the knights of the barations and old people, wild and sentinel, mercenaries and giants standing shoulder to the shoulder under this banner. They were led by a man with a pale face, icy skin and black frozen eyes\n\nWhat kind of leader or lord could gather such a strange army? Why did the warriors not kill each other, and together went to destroy the Bolton? Lianna did not know whether this lord or the enemy did not know, but she approved his actions with all her soul. After all, the enemy of my enemy is another problem for the enemy.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.21.description" : "An albino raven caught Lianna during her next transition. Lady Mormont attempted to occupy every sawmill she could reach in Wolf\"s Wood. This was the only way she could obtain enough building material for the fortifications of Mirkwood. Without high barricades and deep ditches, alas, any blow from the Boltons would be fatal for her.\n \t\nThe raven sat on the scruff of her horse and carefully looked into the eyes of a man with his scarlet gaze. A small piece of parchment was attached to the crown's leg sealed by black wax, on which the emblem of the new, unknown Lianna Lord - three heads of Lutovolka flaunted.\n\nWithout hesitation, Lianna opened the letter and began to read the lines.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.22.description" : "\"Lady Mormont,\n\nWhen I lived in Winterfell, I did not know you. Lately I've had too many names given to me by my ancestors, but if you've heard of me, it's only as Jon Snow, the bastard of Eddard from the Stark family. \n\nI have heard about your plans to drive out the family of traitors and murderers of my mother and brother from Winterfell, and I will be glad to provide you with all possible assistance in this. Afterwards, I hope you will not refuse to dine with me in the halls of my family and swear allegiance to the rightful King of the North.\n\nSee you in a battle under the walls of Winterfell.\n\nThe King of the North and the Seven Kingdoms, Jaheyris Targaryen. \"",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.23.description" : "Lianna had a sharp mind, but the letter still could focus it. John Snow returned, changed his name, gathered a powerful army from former enemies, and now there is one way along with her. And ... the king of the North? How legitimate Lianna did not know his rights to the throne. She did not know the reasons why the brother of the night patrol betrayed his oath and went to war to the south. What happened in the world while she waged her little partisan war? Is this endless battle of kings not end until the last lord folds his head on the field of another bloody battle? \n\nLianna had many questions, but she had to postpone the answers to them. Now she knew the main thing: she had three allies and an enemy clamped in the ring. Hope returned to her, as if she had never left.",

Among the lands, for many years suffering from civil strife and wars, this stream was like a bright star among the night and cruel sky.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.25.description" : "- What were you fed while you were in captivity? - asked Leri in his characteristic manner. \n\nThe feeling of tact was not among the virtues of the pirate, because Darissey was not offended by his words. But the return of memory there, to the cold camera in the basement of Zmeiden\"s castle, immediately knocked out of it all good emotions from eating a delicious pie.\n\n- Rice, bread, enough for the main gift and toy of the lord of the penalty to last as long as possible, but not enough for me to escape or resist. Once one of the servants brought me a pumpkin. When I found out about it, he personally chopped off the servant's arms and legs, and then burned with a steel stigma so that he did not die right away. He threw him into my cell and forced him to watch how the poor man dies of pain, thirst and hunger. The servant could only shout and roar all three days while he lived. When he died, his body was carried away, but I could not stop hearing his screams.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.26.description" : "\"It must have been unpleasant,\" Leri said. \"Now you can sleep in silence as long as you want.\"\n\n– Tell me... is everything always so simple for you?\n\n- Yes. Pirates don\"t live for yesterday. Suffering for the past and all sorts of worries are certainly not about us. Where would we be if the wind did not drive us forward along the waves of our destinies?\n\n\"Your philosophy is simple and therefore very difficult to come to terms with,\" the sorceress smiled.\n\n- Not everything in life should be complicated. Someday you will learn to be as free pirate as me!\n\n- Really? – asked the priestess. – I thought that our paths would diverge.\n\nLeri, nicknamed the Trumpeter, laughed heartily and poured himself more wine.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.27.description" : "- Darling, I didn't storm the castle of the penalty for that, I didn't break out the door of your camera for that, I didn't take care of you all this time, I didn't fight with the captain of the ship when he did not want to take you aboard and did not then take his place to abandon your treasure. Not for that I agreed to help you in this mission and sailed with you half a world to abandon like this, in the unknown. I will go to the end with you. So get ready, you will have to endure me until the waves are closed over my head and the black kraken will not take my body with him to the bottom!",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.28.description" : "Darissey smiled. Ten years in captivity at the penalty cost one salvation. Darissey was never happy to anyone as this dashing pirate that he carried her out of the castle six months ago. During this time, they had a countless number of conversations in his captain's cabin. He told her about his short but rich life, and she was about her, long, but for the most part monotonous and dreary.\n\nNow she had to go with him and protect the little girl who was fighting a war in the north. And maybe die shoulder to shoulder. Not the best thoughts for the night, she thought, and instead of thinking more about the future, she simply kissed her savior. How many more times will he have to save her in the future? How many days do they have left in this world? The candle flame did not give an answer, and Darisseya did not want to ask. She wanted to feel this exact moment. The moment where she was with her pirate. And the rest was not important.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.29.description" : "The next morning, Leri went with his pirates on a long swimming. They had to go around the mainland from the south and occupy the Torchens, the castle, from which it was easier for the pirates to wage a war on the side of Lianna Mormont. Just arriving in Westeros, Darissey realized that her journey from Ashai lasted more than twelve years. Shipwreck, betrayal, captivity, escape, and again endless waters. Lianna, the child of the North, the one that the Lord of the Light instructed her to defend, managed to grow. Now the young warrior takes revenge on the killers of her relatives, going to a war, in which she cannot be defeated. At least - alone. \n\nWhen Leri took the castle, Darissey sent a message to Lianna, where she promised help and protection. She did not know if the girl would believe her, but she was hoping for it very much. The northerners were harsh people, and this baby experienced too much to trust the first stranger who came to help. All that Darissey could go its way to the end and fulfill the mission, for which she escaped from Ashai once for a very long time.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.3.description" : "- Lianna? Little Lianna? But she is all ...\n\n- Twelve years. But this does not prevent her from killing the enemies of the Stark as quickly as her ancestors did. She beat the boltons so much that they were forced to leave Dredfort and rush their views on the wolf forest. That is why we did not suffer any losses during the assault. \n\n– What do you intend to do with her?\n\n\"I will declare her about my rights to the crown of the North and she will follow me.\"\n\nSansa was waiting. John was going to say something else, but hesitated.\n\n\"And still, we will not have enough of these forces,\" he finally added.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.30.description" : "The fireplace fireplace in the White Harbor was burning so that the whole castle warmed. It was not without magic, which the scarlet woman did not want to hide. Today, the lord of Sveta showed her new visions, and Darissee peered into the flame so exhaustively that she burned her eyebrows and part of her hair.\n\nThe Boltons were in the first vision, Darisseya had no doubt about that. Roose and Ramsay\"s pale eyes were their distinguishing feature. There was cruelty in them. They showed composure, prudence and vindictiveness. They already knew about Lianna and were preparing to attack Mirkwood with small forces. \n\nRamsay proposed to set the castle on fire so as not to waste time and effort on a long siege, but Ruse was against it, pointing out that the northerners were already reluctant to recognize him as the Guardian of the North, and if he began to burn their ancestral castles, he would not wear his head for long on the shoulders.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.31.description" : "After this, the vision changed. At first Darisseya could not understand what it was because of the emptiness that had opened before her, and then she saw that the veil in the fire was snowy. A strange young man stood on the walls of a burning castle. His eyes were black and his skin was pale. He himself was like stone and ice, and the glances turned in his direction were frozen in admiration. Hundreds of ears caught his every word and remembered it until the end of their days. Hundreds of hands raised their weapons as the man fell silent. Hundreds of mouths in different dialects shouted greetings to their leader. The man was scary, his face was dotted with temples. He was dead, but his heart was beating.\n\nHis name was Jaehaerys, and he came to Winterfell to reclaim what was rightfully his.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.32.description" : "When the vision ended, Darissei immediately recorded everything that she saw and sent a message to Leri. The pirate should know that he was waiting and being ready to meet much more enemies than they could expect.\n\nBoltons and a dead man... The north promised many surprises and new clashes. Darisseya knelt by the fireplace, closed her eyes and began to pray that she would meet Leri and that the Lord of Light would never leave him. This pirate was capable of many things, but his recklessness could one day play him in a game that he could not win. \n\nDarissey opened her eyes, got up and took a candle from the table. She walked through all the rooms of the castle and lit all the candles that she could only find. While the light is on in the windows, there will be no place in human hearts.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.33.description" : "The lady in a blue dress, which was hidden by a black fluffy fur coat, drove into the gate of the White Harbor with the look as if she had returned to her home. The chestnut strands were scattered along her shoulders, like autumn foliage fell on a beautiful blue river.\n\nIn appearance, she was only sixteen, but her eyes ... Darissey saw in them the years of deprivation, as if they were sitting with this girl in a cell on Big Morak and together experienced the horror that the ruler of pile arranged.\n\nDarisseya herself came out to meet the guest, but she, noticing the red woman, forced her horse to take a couple of steps back.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.34.description" : "\"Don't be afraid, child,\" Darisseya said in the sweetest voice she could muster.\n\n\"Fear is not the feeling that people in the red clothes of my family inspire,\" she answered. - Hatred. Contempt. Resentment. \n\n-Well, if you, dear guest, once had not too pleasant meetings with the followers of the Lord, then I assure me that I do not look like them at all.\n\n- What is the difference? You burn some people and send others to death, \"the girl said contemptuously.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.35.description" : "\"Like any Lord of this region, as far as I know,\" the priestess retorted. - You are waging wars with fire and sword, send the innocent to decorate the fields of meaningless battles, and all in order to delay the next war. The lord of the light illuminates the path of the righteous and gives hope in the cold. And what do your military leaders do when the wars end? Do they give their soldiers new houses, do they help to sow land? No, they just let those home if they were lucky. Someone is given a title, someone is a wallet of gold coins, but there are clearly not enough titles and coins for everyone.\n\n\"We fight wars for tomorrow, stranger, the rest is not so important.\" We go to bed with those we don\"t love so that ordinary people can live another day without war. We cut each other up in tournaments so that ordinary people never try on the armor.\n\n- And my lord takes the weak so that the strong can meet the morning. Do not blame him until you understand all his plans, \"said Darissey. - Or, at least, until you introduce you.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.36.description" : "- My name Sansa Stark. You must forgive me for rude words, I did not expect to see the followers of R'glora here. When my brother sent me to a white harbor, he did not say a word about who I will meet here.\n\n\"You must forgive me too,\" Darisseya smiled. \"It is not the custom of my region to enter into an argument with a guest without giving him some decoctions to drink and without giving him a rest from the road.\"\n\nTheir next conversation took place well after midnight. The North, as Darisseya was able to see, was an amazing place. The people here were hard and stubborn, like frozen mountains, but inside they had warm hearts, and at any moment anyone could become a living volcano. ",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.37.description" : "The guest turned out to be from an ancient family of this region, which had long ago lost power over it due to the betrayal of their former standard-bearers. Now Sansa\"s brother is going to reclaim the entire northern kingdom and take revenge. Darisseya listened to the guest attentively, without talking about the fact that there is a real war going on in the world and it is much more important than the petty squabbles of the Starks, Boltons and Mormonts. However, they also talked about Lianna and came to the conclusion that she should choose for herself a king whom she considers worthy. \n\nIn the meantime, they all had a common goal.\n\nTwo days later, Sansa left for her brother with good news, but leaving Darissey with gloomy thoughts. The priestess was here for only a few months, and already stood in the center of the war with many fronts. Nevertheless, she has less for one enemy. ",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.38.description" : "Darissea hastened to warn Leri that he should under no circumstances fight with the army of Jaehaerys. \n\nAt least for now.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.39.description" : "Leri, nicknamed the Trumpeter, sailed from White Harbor with a heavy heart and gloomy thoughts. Six months have passed since he became the captain of the ship, having crushed the head of the previous captain with a stone, and exactly six months since he had not parted for a day with the prisoner of the castle on Great Morak that he had saved. \n\nDarisseya saw him off on the pier and Leri began to regret leaving her so soon. No woman has ever seen a pirate off on a long voyage with such a look. Now they will not see each other, perhaps never.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.4.description" : "\"We could bring in old Stark allies,\" Sansa suggested.\n\n\"Of those who have not yet been hunted down and intimidated by the Boltons, only Manderly remains. They might be able to help us. It is useless to send a letter; the Manderlys are very distrustful, especially now that there are few of them left. I want to send Davos to them when he gets better.\n\nTo the throat of Sansa rolled a lump. Has John completely outstand all his feelings and does not understand what happened to the onion knight?\n\n\"I'm not a monster, sister, I know what condition he's in and what he's gone through.\" I\"ll give him two weeks to recover. In the meantime, make sure he gets better and doesn\"t need anything.\n\nSansa answered nothing. She came out of the frosty Chertog faster than tears rolled down her cheeks.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.40.description" : "The pirate climbed onto the deck and breathed in the sea air. No matter how much he wanted to be with his red priestess, there was little that could compare with the smell of the sea and the sea wind. The next four months would be perhaps the most dangerous of his life. He had to go around the mainland, pass by the iron fleet of the Greyjoys and the pirates of the southern seas, and not meet the punitive fleets of Highgarden and King\"s Landing, the sentinel galleys of Sunspear and the mercenaries of the Free Cities. \n\nJust! \n\nBut then things were to become even more dangerous.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.41.description" : "Leri completed his mission on time and was even surprised at how easy it all worked out for him. The Lords of Westeros were so mired in their own wars that they did not pay attention to the only ship that plowed the waves near their shores. The ship, meanwhile, brought with it a new war. Having landed at Torhen\"s Lot, Leri announced the mobilization of forces and occupied the city as quickly as he could, which he immediately told about in a letter to Darisse. Now they will have to forget about water, because the war they started will take place on land.\n\nDarissey ordered to protect the little girl-warrior-well, so it is to be so. The girl Mormont fought somewhere in the north and Lery\"s task was to support her with all possible forces. Pirates never fought for other people, but having met Darissai, Leri realized that the world had long changed and \"never\" in it became a forbidden word. Today you think about wealth and storm the locks for them, and then it turns out that money is not at all that you have been looking for all your life, and life itself does not cost anything without a beautiful and only woman nearby.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.42.description" : "The reciprocal raven flew late, the frosty north winds that were knocked down even by the strongest birds interfered with him. Leri rarely met the winter, always preferring warm southern waters, sandy beaches and tanned beauties. The fur coats and insulated trousers were new to him, but while he was waiting for a bird from Darissai, he even managed to get used to them. \n\n\"Everything is better than a block,\" said a pirate proverb that helps every dashing sailor cope with any lifelessness.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.43.description" : "Darissey wrote with uneven handwriting, clearly in a hurry and worried. She said that she would notify Lianna that Leri herself would be with her as soon as possible, and also advised Leri to move north as soon as he was ready. \n\nApparently, helping the little girl consisted not only of teaching etiquette and tying a colorful ribbon in her braid, but also of storming the old castle in the very center of these lands. \n\nLeri was happy. Any fight is better than an inglorious death. Any action is better than sitting down. Moreover, war is a good way to keep warm.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.44.description" : "Leri received the new news from Darissai unexpectedly. Darissey warned him about two possible enemies, of which he could meet in his path. A certain Lord Bolton was sitting in the very castle that the girl Lianna was about to take. The second possible enemy came from the even more distant north. \n\nDarisseya saw him on fire, and she did not like what she saw. His skin was as pale as snow, and in his hands was a sword as cold as ice. This terrible man brought with him a powerful and dangerous army of people and monsters, and his plans were the same as Lyanna\"s. Who knows how he will react to the encroachment on his prey, and whether he will want to get rid of his competitors first?\n\nLeri, however, did not attach any importance to this. He had seen various enemies, lords and leaders, infectious stone giants and beastmen, and Leri could easily bleed any of them. He did not want to make exceptions for the northerners.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.45.description" : "\"Whistle all nav...\" Leri began to shout commands, but restrained himself in time. On land they don't shout like that, and they don't like to whistle here.\n\nLeri did not like such wars, knee -deep in the mud, ankle in blood. There is nowhere to wash off the abomination and smell, nowhere to throw the bodies of defeated enemies. During the pirate raids, at least the fish were always full, and here, after the battles, a very unsightly picture remained. \n\nCaptain Leri Trubach really wanted to put an end to this war and again sail to the sunset. And he would also take Darissay with him. And Lianna, what is it there, would have taken away if Darissey refused to swim without her. I would take it by force if it had been required. \n\nThoughts about this, as well as many stolen barrels of wine, helped him fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_die.event.46.description" : "Now Darissea sent ravens more often to keep him informed of her military campaign, and the words in her letters were filled with both anxiety and joy. The last raven sat on Leri\"s shoulder, as if he was not afraid of being roasted for dinner by his pirates.\n\n\"A stupid bird,\" the captain grinned.\n\n- Millet! – the raven croaked and ruffled Leri's hair.\n\n- Well, look, if the news is kind, you will be full. If it's bad, then my dog ​​will be full, and your feathers will go to my pillow. Happy? That is, on the wings ... Ay, okay!",

They will also help Lianna in her campaign on Winterfell, which means that you should not repair it in this.\n\nI hope for your sanity, and hold your ear in sharp.

You still can\"t hit soldiers with bears on their shields. And, of course, you can't beat soldiers with wolves on their shields. \n\nLeri thought against whom he had to fight and called Jung behind a new jug of wine. He thought best to his drunken head.",

Sansa brought him melt water and wiped her forehead, but the heat and fever could not be calm down. Measters said that his disease was not physical, and medicines could not help here. Sansa understood everything. The onion knight saw the worst evil committed in the name of good, and he himself was one foot in the darkness when he performed justice. After this, not everyone will find the road back.\n\nJohn went to the smuggler bed and looked at him sternly.\n\n\"If he cannot rise until the evening, then at dawn you will go south,\" he turned to his sister, not taking his eyes off the patient.",

And it seems to me that he...\" Sansa wanted to object, but Jon cut her off mid-sentence.\n\n- There is no Manderly in White Harbor. Not anymore. The Boltons cut them out months ago.\n\nSansa couldn\"t believe her ears. What struck her more was not what John said, but the way it was said. John said the words about the death of old Stark friends as if he brushed a snowflake off his sleeve.",

I don't know their purpose, but they are not in a hurry to the Boltons and are not going south, which means they are clearly not friends of our enemies. I want you to go to them, find out who they are and, if possible, convince you to join our campaign. You are a good enough diplomat and I can trust you with this mission. I\"ll take care of the Mormont girl myself. She, as far as I remember, will not do business with anyone other than the rightful King of the North. In our current situation - with no one but me.\n\n– But Davos...\n\n- They will take care of him. Now our war is much larger than the life of one smuggler. Even if our friend.\n\nSansa could not answer anything. She turned to Davos and rubbed her face again.

Lianna will obey, but will surely require her later. The fact that the Boltons were so easily handed over to Dredfort exclusively her merit. For several months the little girl terrorized the keepers of the North, which is why their main forces were sent to Winterfell, and did not guard the tribal nest. Even now, when Dredfort fell, the bolts are looking west, and not east, seeing a great threat in Lianna's little army than that John brought from the wall.\n\nJon Snow\"s half-dead fingers, covered with ice, clenched into fists and crunched.

Now the young warrior takes revenge on the murderers of her relatives, going to a war that she cannot win. At least alone. \n\nWhen Leri took the castle, Darissey sent a message to Lianna, where she promised help and protection. She did not know if the girl would believe her, but she was hoping for it very much. The northerners were harsh people, and this baby experienced too much to trust the first stranger who came to help. All that Darissey could go its way to the end and fulfill the mission, for which she escaped from Ashai once for a very long time.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.3.description" : "- Lianna? Little Lianna? But she just...\n\n- Twelve years. But this does not prevent her from killing the enemies of the Stark as quickly as her ancestors did. She beat the boltons so much that they were forced to leave Dredfort and rush their views on the wolf forest. That is why we did not suffer any losses during the assault. \n\n– What do you intend to do with her?\n\n\"I will declare to her my rights to the crown of the North and she will follow me.\"\n\nSansa was waiting. John was going to say something else, but hesitated.\n\n\"And still, we will not have enough of these forces,\" he finally added.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.30.description" : "The fireplace fireplace in the White Harbor was burning so that the whole castle warmed. It was not without magic, which the scarlet woman did not want to hide. Today, the lord of Sveta showed her new visions, and Darissee peered into the flame so exhaustively that she burned her eyebrows and part of her hair.\n\nThe Boltons were in the first vision, Darisseya had no doubt about that. Roose and Ramsay\"s pale eyes were their distinguishing feature. There was cruelty in them. They showed composure, prudence and vindictiveness. They already knew about Lianna and were preparing to attack Mirkwood with small forces. \n\nRamsey proposed to give the castle to fire so as not to waste time and effort on a long siege, but Rus was against, indicating that the northerners were so reluctant to recognize him as the keeper of the North, and if he began to burn their tribal locks, he would not wear his head for a long time On the shoulders.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.31.description" : "After this, the vision changed. At first Darisseya could not understand what it was because of the emptiness that had opened before her, and then she saw that the veil in the fire was snowy. A strange young man stood on the walls of a burning castle. His eyes were black and his skin was pale. He himself was like stone and ice, and the glances turned in his direction were frozen in admiration. Hundreds of ears caught his every word and remembered it until the end of their days. Hundreds of hands raised their weapons as the man fell silent. Hundreds of mouths in different dialects shouted greetings to their leader. The man was scary, his face was dotted with temples. He was dead, but his heart was beating.\n\nHis name was Jaehaerys, and he came to Winterfell to reclaim what was rightfully his.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.32.description" : "When the vision ended, Darisseya immediately wrote down everything she saw and sent a message to Leri. The pirate should have known what awaited him and be prepared to meet many more enemies than they could have expected.\n\nBoltons and a dead man... The north promised many surprises and new clashes. Darisseya knelt by the fireplace, closed her eyes and began to pray that she would meet Leri and that the Lord of Light would never leave him. This pirate was capable of many things, but his recklessness could one day play him in a game that he could not win. \n\nDarisseya opened her eyes, stood up and took a candle from the table. She walked through all the rooms of the castle and lit all the candles she could find. As long as the light is burning in the windows, darkness will have no place in people\"s hearts.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.33.description" : "The lady in a blue dress, which was hidden by a black fluffy fur coat, drove into the gate of the White Harbor with the look as if she had returned to her home. The chestnut strands were scattered along her shoulders, like autumn foliage fell on a beautiful blue river.\n\nIn appearance, she was only sixteen, but her eyes ... Darissey saw in them the years of deprivation, as if they were sitting with this girl in a cell on Big Morak and together experienced the horror that the ruler of pile arranged.\n\nDarisseya herself came out to meet the guest, but she, noticing the red woman, forced her horse to take a couple of steps back.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.34.description" : "\"Don't be afraid, child,\" Darisseya said in the sweetest voice she could muster.\n\n\"Fear is not the feeling that people in the red clothes of my family inspire,\" she answered. - Hatred. Contempt. Resentment. \n\n-Well, if you, dear guest, once had not too pleasant meetings with the followers of the Lord, then I assure me that I do not look like them at all.\n\n-What\"s the difference? \"You burn some people and send others to death,\" the girl said contemptuously.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.35.description" : "\"Like any lord of this region, as far as I know,\" the priestess retorted. \"You wage wars with fire and sword, you send innocents to decorate the fields of meaningless battles, and all in order to postpone the next war. The Lord of Light illuminates the path of the righteous and gives hope in the cold. What do your military leaders do when wars end? Do they give their soldiers new houses, do they help sow the land? No, they just let them go home if they\"re lucky. Some are given a title, others a purse of gold coins, but there are clearly not enough titles and coins for everyone.\n\n\"We fight wars for tomorrow, stranger, the rest is not so important.\" We go to bed with those we don\"t love so that ordinary people can live another day without war. We cut each other up in tournaments so that ordinary people never try on the armor.\n\n\"And my Lord takes the weak so that the strong can meet the morning.\" Don't judge him until you understand all his plans,\" said Darissea. \"Or at least until you introduce yourself.\"",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.36.description" : "- My name Sansa Stark. You must forgive me for rude words, I did not expect to see the followers of R'glora here. When my brother sent me to a white harbor, he did not say a word about who I will meet here.\n\n\"You must forgive me too,\" Darissey smiled. - Not according to the customs of my region to enter into disputes with the guest, without drinking it with decoctions and not letting him rest from the road.\n\nTheir next conversation took place well after midnight. The North, as Darisseya was able to see, was an amazing place. The people here were hard and stubborn, like frozen mountains, but inside they had warm hearts, and at any moment anyone could become a living volcano. ",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.37.description" : "The guest turned out to be from the ancient family of this region, which has long lost power over him because of the betrayal of their former banners. Now Sansa's brother is going to regain the whole northern kingdom and take revenge. Darissey carefully listened to the guest, not saying that there was a real war in the world and it is much more important than the small squabbles of Starkov, Bolton and Mormonts. About Lianna, however, they also talked and came to the fact that she should choose the king herself, whom she will consider worthy. \n\nIn the meantime, they all had a common goal.\n\nTwo days later, Sansa left for her brother with good news, but leaving Darissey with gloomy thoughts. The priestess was here for only a few months, and already stood in the center of the war with many fronts. Nevertheless, she has less for one enemy. ",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.38.description" : "Darissey hastened to warn Leri that he would in no case fight with the army of Jaheiris. \n\nAt least for now.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.39.description" : "Leri, nicknamed the Trumpeter, sailed from White Harbor with a heavy heart and gloomy thoughts. Six months have passed since he became the captain of the ship, having crushed the head of the previous captain with a stone, and exactly six months since he had not parted for a day with the prisoner of the castle on Great Morak that he had saved. \n\nDarissey escorted him on the pier and Leri began to regret that he had left her so soon. Not a single woman had yet escorted a pirate into a long swimming with such a gaze. Now they will not be seen, perhaps never.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.4.description" : "\"We could bring in old Stark allies,\" Sansa suggested.\n\n- Of those who had not yet been produced and not intimidated, only Manderli remained. They may be able to help us. It is useless to send a letter, Manderley is very distrustful, especially now, when there are few of them. I want to send Davos to them when he gets better.\n\nTo the throat of Sansa rolled a lump. Has John completely outstand all his feelings and does not understand what happened to the onion knight?\n\n\"I'm not a monster, sister, I know what condition he's in and what he's gone through.\" I\"ll give him two weeks to recover. In the meantime, make sure he gets better and doesn\"t need anything.\n\nSansa didn\"t answer. She left the frosty hall faster than the tears rolled down her cheeks.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.40.description" : "The pirate climbed onto the deck and breathed in the sea air. No matter how much he wanted to be with his red priestess, there was little that could compare with the smell of the sea and the sea wind. The next four months would be perhaps the most dangerous of his life. He had to go around the mainland, pass by the iron fleet of the Greyjoys and the pirates of the southern seas, and not meet the punitive fleets of Highgarden and King\"s Landing, the sentinel galleys of Sunspear and the mercenaries of the Free Cities. \n\nJust everything! \n\nBut then everything was supposed to become even more dangerous.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.41.description" : "Leri fulfilled his mission on time and was even surprised how just everything worked out for him. The Lords of Westeros had so much mired in their own wars that they did not pay attention to the only boat that plowed the waves near their shores. The ship, meanwhile, carried a new war with it. Having landed at Torkhenov, Leri announced his mobilization of his strength and occupied the city as quickly as he could, which he immediately told Darissey in a letter. Now you will have to forget about the water, because the war, that they started, will go on land.\n\nDarisseya ordered to protect the little warrior girl - well, that means so be it. The Mormont girl was fighting somewhere in the north and Leri's task was to support her with all possible forces. Pirates never fought for other people, but having met Darisseya, Leri realized that the world had long ago changed and \"never\" had become a forbidden word in it. Today you think about riches and storm castles for them, and then it turns out that money is not at all what you have been looking for all your life, and life itself is worth nothing without the beautiful and only woman nearby.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.42.description" : "The response raven arrived late, hampered by the frosty northern winds that knocked down even the strongest birds. Leri rarely saw winter, always preferring warm southern waters, sandy beaches and tanned beauties. Fur coats and insulated trousers were new to him, but while he was waiting for the bird from Darisseya, he even managed to get used to them. \n\n\"Everything is better than a block,\" said a pirate proverb that helps every dashing sailor cope with any lifelessness.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.43.description" : "Darissey wrote with uneven handwriting, clearly in a hurry and worried. She said that she would notify Lianna that Leri herself would be with her as soon as possible, and also advised Leri to move north as soon as he was ready. \n\nApparently, helping the little girl consisted not only of teaching etiquette and tying a colorful ribbon in her braid, but also of storming the old castle in the very center of these lands. \n\nLeri rejoiced. Any fight is better than an inglorious death. Any action is better than to attach the task. Moreover, the war is a good way to warm up.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.44.description" : "Leri received new news from Darisseya unexpectedly. Darisseya warned him about two possible enemies that he might meet on his way. A certain Lord Bolton was sitting in the very castle that the girl Lianna was going to take. The second possible enemy came from even further north. \n\nDarissey saw him in fire, and she did not like what she saw. His skin was pale, like snow, and in his hands was a sword, cold, like ice. This terrible man brought with him a powerful and dangerous army of people and monsters, and his plans were the same as Lianna. Who knows how he will react to the encroachment on his prey, and will he want to get rid of competitors to begin with?\n\nLeri, however, did not attach any importance to this. He saw different enemies, lords and leaders, stone contagious giants and beasts, and any of them could easily let in blood. For northerners, he did not want to make exceptions.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.45.description" : "\"Walking around everyone ...\" Leri began to shout the teams, but restrained himself in time. They don't shout like that on land, and they don't like to whistle here.\n\nLeri did not like such wars, knee -deep in the mud, ankle in blood. There is nowhere to wash off the abomination and smell, nowhere to throw the bodies of defeated enemies. During the pirate raids, at least the fish were always full, and here, after the battles, a very unsightly picture remained. \n\nCaptain Leri Trubach really wanted to put an end to this war and again sail to the sunset. And he would also take Darissay with him. And Lianna, what is it there, would have taken away if Darissey refused to swim without her. I would take it by force if it had been required. \n\nThoughts about this, as well as many stolen barrels of wine, helped him fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.46.description" : "Now Darissey sent ravons more and more often to keep him in the know of her military campaign, and the words in her letters were filled with anxiety or joy. The last raven sat on Leri on his shoulder, as if he was not afraid to be fired for dinner with his pirates.\n\n\"A stupid bird,\" the captain grinned.\n\n- Millet! – the raven croaked and ruffled Leri's hair.\n\n- Well, look, if the news is good, then you will be full. If it's bad, then my dog ​​will be well-fed, and your feathers will go on my pillow. Hands down? That is, on the wings... oh, okay!",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.47.description" : "Leri tore the message from the raven\"s leg and recognized Darissea\"s familiar smooth handwriting.\n\n\"Dear Leri,\n\nToday, the walls of my shelter were left by a girl who called the sister of that terrible military leader of the North. \n\nI can\"t fully trust either her or him, but for now we\"ve come to a compromise. They will also help Lyanna in her campaign against Winterfell, which means that you should not obstruct them in this.\n\nI hope for your sanity, and hold your ear in sharp. Let the lord of light keep you, for the night is dark and full of nightmares.\n\nYour Darissey \"",

You can't hit soldiers with bears on the shields. Well, of course, you can't beat soldiers with wolves on the shields. \n\nLeri thought against whom he had to fight and called Jung behind a new jug of wine. He thought best to his drunken head.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.5.description" : "Davos did not get out of bed from the day he was located in Dredfort. Sansa brought him melt water and wiped her forehead, but the heat and fever could not be calm down. Measters said that his disease was not physical, and medicines could not help here. Sansa understood everything. The onion knight saw the worst evil committed in the name of good, and he himself was one foot in the darkness when he performed justice. After this, not everyone will find the road back.\n\nJohn walked over to the smuggler\"s bed and looked at him sternly.\n\n\"If he can't get up before the evening, then at dawn you will go south,\" he turned to his sister, without taking his eyes off the patient.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.6.description" : "\"Manderley almost does not know me, but with Davos they had agreements.\" And it seems to me that he ... - Sanse wanted to resist, but John cut her off at a half.\n\n\"Manderli is not in the White Harbor.\" No more. The bolts cut them out a few months ago.\n\nSansa could not believe her ears. She was struck by John not said, but, as it was said. John uttered the words about the death of the old friends of the Starkov seemed to brush a snowflake from the sleeve.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.7.description" : "\"Now a new army has arrived there. From Essos. I don't know their purpose, but they are not in a hurry to the Boltons and are not going south, which means they are clearly not friends of our enemies. I want you to go to them, find out who they are and, if possible, convince you to join our campaign. You are a good enough diplomat and I can trust you with this mission. I\"ll take care of the Mormont girl myself. She, as far as I remember, will not do business with anyone other than the rightful King of the North. In our current situation - with no one but me.\n\n– But Davos...\n\n- They will take care of him. Now our war is much larger than the life of one smuggler. Even if our friend.\n\nSansa could not answer anything. She turned to Davos and rubbed her face again. The next morning she had a way to a white harbor, and no one knew how this journey could end for her.",
	"map.hota_winterfell_1_1_you_win.event.8.description" : "The White Raven looked carefully at John and, in anticipation, turned his head. \n\nThe letter for Lyanna Mormont lay before the King of the North, but he could not bring himself to fold it and seal it with sealing wax. Lianna will obey, but will probably demand her own later. The fact that the Boltons surrendered the Dreadfort so easily was entirely her merit. The little girl terrorized the Guardians of the North for several months, which is why their main forces were sent to Winterfell rather than guarding their family nest. Even now that the Dreadfort has fallen, the Boltons look west rather than east, seeing Lyanna\"s small army as a greater threat than the one Jon brought from the Wall.\n\nJohn Snow\"s half -dead fingers clenched into fists and crumbled. He was no longer a man - at least he was not completely sure of this - but human feelings involuntarily made themselves felt. ",
